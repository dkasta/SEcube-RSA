\chapter*{Abstract}
The purpose of this project is to add support to RSA cryptography and X.509
certificates to SEcube devices, by adding these functionalities to the firmware
and exposing them through a level 1 API on the host side.
\par
The initial objective was to implement the RSA cipher in hardware, on the
SEcube FPGA, but due to limitations of the HW at disposal, a full software
implementation seemed the best choice, using \texttt{mbedtls} by ARM as
underlying library for cryptography functionalities.
