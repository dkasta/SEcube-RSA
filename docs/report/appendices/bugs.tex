\chapter{SEcube SDK bugs}
During the developement phase some bugs in the SDK code have been identified,
fixed and reported to the maintainer.
\section{SEcube firmware}
\subsection{\texttt{se3\_key\_read}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Severity}: critical
	\item \emph{Cause}: buffer over-read: a wrong offset was used when
		reading from a buffer, therefore some useful data were ignored
		and some garbage values were read instead.
	\item \emph{Consequence}: broken initialization of all algorithms
		requiring cryptographic keys.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{\texttt{key\_find}}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Severity}: minor
	\item \emph{Cause}:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item buffer over-read: a wrong offset was used when
				reading from a buffer, therefore some useful data were ignored
				and some garbage values were read instead.
			\item reversed response: the firmware sent 0 in case of
				hit and 1 in case of miss, but the L1 libraries
				expected the opposite.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \emph{Consequence}: broken \texttt{L1::L1FindKey}.
\end{itemize}
